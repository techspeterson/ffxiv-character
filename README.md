# FFXIV Character Viewer (or something like that)

An app for viewing Final Fantasy XIV character data using [XIVAPI](https://xivapi.com/). Not sure yet if it will be possible to create the desired functionality for this app (a tracker for job quest progress) with the way the API works, but I'll continue working this into something regardless.

Created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

Users can search all FFXIV player characters by name and return a list of all matching results. Selecting a character (by clicking them) will load the character's data into the app (though there's not much actual data displaying... yet).

## Coming Soon
- More actual character data!
- Character ID will persist in browser
- Some sort of other functionality, perhaps (I'll figure out something)
